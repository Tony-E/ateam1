# ateam1
Website for the A-Team. (A group of asteroid trackers using Slooh.com robotic scopes). 

The website is intended to support A-Team members with tutorials, links and tools. 
The website is deployed on IFPS using Fleek and can be seen at A-Team.space.

Update: This site is now deployed in Github Pages as IFPS is not working very well and Fleek is too expensive!
